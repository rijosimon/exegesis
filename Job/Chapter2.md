# Chapter 2

### Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?

The Devil pursues the adversity on Job further to include his health. The two material resources that men depend on to climb up in the world are now overwhelmingly absent to Job. His wealth, or lack thereof, restricts him to live a life of destitution. This is now compounded by the fact that Job has a health defect that restricts his ability to interact with the community he is from.

What is interesting is how God comments on what has befallen Job as something 'without reason.' Even God, who cannot lie, accepts that Job doesn't deserve what has come to him. Yet God doesn't do anything without reason, and his purpose is divine and eternal, not to be challenged.

If one can see behind the curtains, as we can, we see God operating with sovereignty and purpose. Yet for someone like Job's wife, who can only see what lies ahead, God seems unfair and unreasonable. And this is a truth of life. Not knowing the plans of God, overwhelmed by the reality of its pains, man is tempted to curse God and die. He seems to think that is the only way to get back at God, the divine Who cannot be touched, but His glory could be possibly be affected by deriding it. Yet God's glory remains intact, and his majesty couldn't be put to question.

But it is this very human instinct that Job's wife gives into when she tells Job:

> "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."  vs. 9

It is very interesting that the very same integrity of Job, that God taunts before Satan, he uses Job's wife to challenge.

What is Job faithful towards? He is faithful to the divine nature of God. He trusts in God's sovereignty over his life. And in this trust lies his integrity. He is faithful to the God of universe, his creator. And it is this faithfulness, the nature of it, that Satan disputes with God about. Here God also comes with accusations of incitation against the Devil.

Ultimately what happens to Job, is part of God's plan to exert his Glory. Not just by proving the lie of Satan, but also by overwhelmingly substantiating God's divine nature of Truth.

And as Job suffers evil from God, so that God's name be glorified, Satan uses his wife, someone whom he loves, and someone whose advice he cannot wholly ignore to prod towards rejecting God. And this is certainly very intriguing. For you can people in your life, your spouse, children, friends, co-workers, bosses etc. who may discourage you in your walk with the Lord when calamity strikes. But our faithfulness and integrity is revealed when we still remain hopeful and faithful in God. Job is able to pass this hurdle with God's grace.

> In all this Job did not sin with his lips. vs. 10
