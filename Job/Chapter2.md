# Chapter 2

### Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?

The Devil pursues the adversity on Job further to include his health. The two material resources that men depend on to climb up in the world are now overwhelmingly absent to Job. His wealth, or lack thereof, restricts him to live a life of destitution. This is now compounded by the fact that Job has a health defect that restricts his ability to interact with the community he is from.

What is interesting is how God comments on what has befallen Job as something 'without reason.' Even God, who cannot lie, accepts that Job doesn't deserve what has come to him. Yet God doesn't do anything without reason, and his purpose is divine and eternal, not to be challenged.

If one can see behind the curtains, as we can, we see God operating with sovereignty and purpose. Yet for someone like Job's wife, who can only see what lies ahead, God seems unfair and unreasonable. And this is a truth of life. Not knowing the plans of God, overwhelmed by the reality of its pains, man is tempted to curse God and die. He seems to think that is the only way to get back at God, the divine Who cannot be touched, but His glory could be possibly be affected by deriding it. Yet God's glory remains intact, and his majesty couldn't be put to question.

But it is this very human instinct that Job's wife gives into when she tells Job:

> "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."  vs. 9

It is very interesting that the very same integrity of Job, that God taunts before Satan, he uses Job's wife to challenge.

What is Job faithful towards? He is faithful to the divine nature of God. He trusts in God's sovereignty over his life. And in this trust lies his integrity. He is faithful to the God of universe, his creator. And it is this faithfulness, the nature of it, that Satan disputes with God about. Here God also comes with accusations of incitation against the Devil.

Ultimately what happens to Job, is part of God's plan to exert his Glory. Not just by proving the lie of Satan, but also by overwhelmingly substantiating God's divine nature of Truth.

And as Job suffers evil from God, so that God's name be glorified, Satan uses his wife, someone whom he loves, and someone whose advice he cannot wholly ignore to prod towards rejecting God. And this is certainly very intriguing. For you can people in your life, your spouse, children, friends, co-workers, bosses etc. who may discourage you in your walk with the Lord when calamity strikes. But our faithfulness and integrity is revealed when we still remain hopeful and faithful in God. Job is able to pass this hurdle with God's grace.

> In all this Job did not sin with his lips. vs. 10

What does the scripture mean when it puts in Job's mouth the following words:

> Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil. vs. 10

The implication that evil can also comes from God could be confounding for some. But let us not explore this verse in isolation, instead let us study the premise of this statement. Truly evil has come to Job. But when Job claims that he has received evil from God, I don't believe it suggests that God is the source of this evil. It is clear from the story that Satan, the adversary, is cause of this evil, though God has allowed it. Does Job then mistakenly believe that God caused evil in his life. Instead when Job tells his wife that the evil he has received is from God, he means to acknowledge God's sovereignty.

All good emanates directly from the throne room of God, and he is fully in control of it. All evil emanates from the heart of Satan, for he is an adversary to mankind. But this doesn't negate the sovereignty of God. He is still in control through the evil. Job in recognizing this nature of God, that He is in control through both good and evil, shows the deep roots of his faith.

### ... they didn't recognize Him.

ELiphaz, Bildad and Zophar are intimate friends of Job. They may not live in the same town, they may not hangout everyday, but there is a relationship amongst that is so deep that even after years going by without talking or having any communication, when they meet, they pickup as if they had met each other last just an hour ago. I know how this feels, for I am blessed with some such friends. Friends are a blessing from God. God uses friends to comfort and encourage. And this is exactly the intention with which Job's three friends have arrived:

> They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him. vs. 11

Friendships are not futile, they are not just worldly relationships. A good Godly friend is a tool in the hand of God to talk to you what is truth, to give you company when you are lost and to encourage you when you want to just lie down and go to eternal sleep.

As Job's friends see him from a distance, they don't recognize him. Imagine, his friends coming to the city where Job lives. The see the city from a distance. As they come closer they see the activities around the city. Men tilling their farms, women pouring water into their jars from the well. They also see in the outskirts of the city where untouchable and diseased are left to fend for themselves. Amongst them they see a unsightly man. One who is full of boils all over his body. He has a broken pottery in his hand which he uses to scratch his diseased skin. It is an abhorrent sight. They wonder who this unfortunate man is, and decide to look away.

But as they come closer to the city, they realize that this man, who they so far thought of as an abomination, was none other that their dear friend Job. Satan the adversary has brought Job down to a place where his own friends are not able to identify him.

Job's friends couldn't identify him for two reasons:

1. They didn't expect to find Job in the circumstances his now. They were not looking for Job in the outskirts of the city sitting with the diseased and the downtrodden.

2. The disease that was upon Job had disfigured him.

ELiphaz, Bildad and Zophar had come to show sympathy to Job and comfort him. But on seeing what has befallen him. On seeing what has truly come upon Job, they are themselves distressed.

> And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw his suffering was very great. vs. 12-13

Sometimes we think we can comfort our friend in distress. But if you truly empathize, you may instead just weep with them.
