# Chapter 1

### Job's righteous walk confounds me.

> ..., and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. vs. 1

> And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil." vs. 8

This testimony in the Word, from God, confounds me. It does so because I just cannot imagine a world, where God can provide this testimony for me. Yet it is this testimony that I desire the most in this world.

On my own strength and understanding I know I cannot ever achieve this nature of testament in my own life. I believe no fallen man can achieve such testament from God without the redemptive nature of Christ's incarnation: life, death and resurrection.

Yet Job receives this highest order of praise from God, in a world where redemption in Christ is yet not accessible. As a fallen sinner all I can hope for in the midst of this confounding description is the redemptive nature of Christ's incarnation. That, clothed in his righteousness I be called blameless and upright.

In the description of Job's standing before God, one thing becomes exceedingly clear. That to be called blameless and upright, one has to live in the all encompassing recognition of what it means to live a life fearing God. The fear of God doesn't result in a life of defeat and anguish. The fear of man will. Instead it results in a life of joy and peace. For when one fears God, they turn away from evil. And it is in the turning away from evil that one receives eternal joy and peace, which this world cannot offer. Because this word has taken after the way of the evil. Job was blameless and upright before God, because he feared God, and this fear of God lead him to walk away from evil.

As much as Job's righteous walk confounds me, because of my own inability to do so. The fact that he fears God, clarifies the reason God and the Word can testify as such about him. It is the fear of God that has given him the wisdom to lead the life of a blameless and upright man.
