# Chapter 1

### Job's righteous walk confounds me.

> ..., and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. vs. 1

> And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil." vs. 8

This testimony in the Word, from God, confounds me. It does so because I just cannot imagine a world, where God can provide this testimony for me. Yet it is this testimony that I desire the most in this world.

On my own strength and understanding I know I cannot ever achieve this nature of testament in my own life. I believe no fallen man can achieve such testament from God without the redemptive nature of Christ's incarnation: life, death and resurrection.

Yet Job receives this highest order of praise from God, in a world where redemption in Christ is yet not accessible. As a fallen sinner all I can hope for in the midst of this confounding description is the redemptive nature of Christ's incarnation. That, clothed in his righteousness I be called blameless and upright.

In the description of Job's standing before God, one thing becomes exceedingly clear. That to be called blameless and upright, one has to live in the all encompassing recognition of what it means to live a life fearing God. The fear of God doesn't result in a life of defeat and anguish. The fear of man will. Instead it results in a life of joy and peace. For when one fears God, they turn away from evil. And it is in the turning away from evil that one receives eternal joy and peace, which this world cannot offer. Because this word has taken after the way of the evil. Job was blameless and upright before God, because he feared God, and this fear of God lead him to walk away from evil.

As much as Job's righteous walk confounds me, because of my own inability to do so. The fact that he fears God, clarifies the reason God and the Word can testify as such about him. It is the fear of God that has given him the wisdom to lead the life of a blameless and upright man.

### The nature of Satan and his relationship with God.

So far in the book of Job, we have a clear picture of two primary natures of Satan. He is the accuser and the adversary.

> Does Job fear God for no reason? vs. 9

Here we see Satan accusing God's servant of material reasons for fearing God. He is more than willing to be an adversary to God's servant to prove his accusations. However it is a matter of great comfort, that in being accusatory and adversarial, Satan doesn't affect God, in that it doesn't cause Him doubt or confusion. God is not doubting Job's righteousness and his fear of Him. God instead is challenging Satan's unfounded accusation. God is not moved by Satan's unfounded accusations, like we Humans may be.

> But stretch out you hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face. vs. 11

On the other hand Satan is very confident in his accusations. He believes that the adversity he brings about is substantial enough to disprove God's testament regarding Job, and make God a liar. Why doesn't Satan recognize that God can never be the liar? This lack of understanding of who God is, and this lack of reverence towards God's sovereignty is the root cause of Satan's fall. It is a lesson for us that we shouldn't do anything that is irreverential towards God's sovereignty. I pray that we shall not entertain any thoughts, any ideas or partake in any actions that question the reverence and subjection that God's sovereignty deserves in our life.

> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. The Lord said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it." vs. 6-7

> And Lord said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has in in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord. vs. 12

From these passages we learn some interesting facts about Satan's interaction with his creator, his relationship with God:

1. Satan and God don't exist in separate silos, there is a communicative relationship between them. Satan is in an interactive relationship with God. They are definitely not equals. For it is Satan who comes to God's throne to present himself. Satan is painfully cognizant of the fact that he is under the sovereignty of God.

2. Continuing from above, Satan is not a free agent. He doesn't interfere in the world, as he desires. All that he does requires the explicit permission or allowing of the creator of the Universe. He has no free reign over anything that is God's. God doesn't allow Satan's reprobation, because it is his will, but because in allowing Satan's reprobation, God's holiness is glorified. For despite Satan's accusatory and adversarial intrusion, God is sovereign over what is His. Job is God's and no amount of effort on Satan's part can take away from God's testimony about him or make Him a liar.

3. Satan still goes to and fro on the earth and walks up and down on it. He does it to accuse and intrude. And he does so to disprove God as Holy, Glorious and Truthful. For his intrusive acts of accusation and adversity are thrust against those that fear the Lord. It is this very nature of Satan, the devil, that Peter warns the Christian of in 1 Peter 5:8:

> Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 1 Peter 5:8

Satan is constantly accusatory and he wants to devour us in the process of proving his accusations. In accusing us, he desires to accuse God of attributes that are not Him. In being constantly watchful of these tactics of the devil, we add to the Glory of God.

#### Prayer:

I pray God helps me learn the tactics of our eternal enemy, and that he solidifies my trust in God's sovereignty and hence trust in God to be fully in control of all my circumstances.

### Worshiping God when calamity strikes.

As we read on, in his adversarial efforts, Satan is permitted by God to strike a blow at Job, and the calamity that befalls him is unimaginable. I wonder what my response would be if I lost every last one of my worldly possessions and every last one of my children, in tragic ways, in a single day. I would most definitely approach God with a sense of unfair treatment. Worshiping God may not be on the top of my list either. And this is exactly why Job strikes me unfamiliar in his response.

Job not only approaches God through these circumstances, to worship and adore him, but with a humble heart and head.

In this time of humiliation and grave calamity, Job gives the best rendition on God's absolute sovereignty over his life:

> Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. vs. 21

What is fascinating for me is not that he has this understanding of who God is, but rather that he is able to keep this in perspective amidst the calamity that has befallen him. My experience so far has been: an inability to keep the divine nature of God in the center of my thoughts, when I face what is hard and intolerable. I am jealous of Job's response, and wish to cultivate the same in my life. I wish to be fully aware of who God is to me, in the midst of both suffering and joy. Everything I have God has provided. So do I have any right to complaint in my losses.

This understanding of God, I believe is central to responding through life's circumstances the same way Job does, in Worship.

#### Prayer:

My prayer is Lord that I may worship you through all. Through the good times and the bad. I want to be aware of who you are to me, even in the moments when I am not able to, on myself. I want to depend on the Holy Spirit to make the reality of God as sovereign, an all encompassing reality of my life.

I want to worship God with a contrite spirit, as Job did, when calamity strikes.
