# Chapter 3

### The ramblings of a depressed man.

Job is clearly depressed at this point. The burden of his adversity seems to start to get to him. He hasn't yet derided God, or sinned against Him. But neither is he at this point a stoic man submissive with heart and spirit to God's will in his life. Instead he complains about the travails of life, and how if certain measures were in place, he wouldn't have to go through all this.

He moans about:

1. The day he was born. (vs. 1-10)
2. Death not taking him the day he was born. (vs. 11-19)
3. Life given by God to a man who cannot take it anymore. (vs. 20-23)

### 1. The day he was born.

Job seems to be deeply anguished regarding the day he was born. For a day about which he has no memory, it seems to be the one that he despises the most. But this despise is not particularly connected to a time, rather it's association with his existence.

> because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes. (vs. 10)

In other words, what Job despises the most is his existence. So anything he seeks over the day he was born, he seeks over his own existence.

What does Job seek over the day he was born in vs. 1-10?

1. He seeks darkness over it:

> Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it. (vs. 2)

> Let gloom and eep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. The night--let thick darkness seize it! (vs. 3-4)

> Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning. (vs. 9)

2. He seeks curses over it:

> Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan. (vs. 8)

3. He seeks the death of that day itself:

> Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.' (vs. 1)

> let it not come into the number of months. (vs. 6)

4. He seeks no joy or rejoicing over it:

> Let gloom and darkness claim it. (vs. 5)

> Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. (vs. 6)

> let no joyful cry enter it. (vs. 7)

### 2. Death not taking him the day he was born.

Job in his anguish now desires death. He in fact regrets that he was allowed to breath any number of days beyond his birth.

But then he channels this anguish into a weird appreciation of being dead. He seems to think there is a great deal of peace in death. He seems to equate death with rest, lacking in troubles and full of freedom.

> For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest. (vs. 13)

> There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest. There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster. The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master. (vs. 17-19)

But what is conspicuously missing is, the recognition of God's presence after this life. For Job, at this point, death is an escape. And in reading this perspective of Job, I am challenged to think about what my perspective on death is? So let me use this space to write it down, and then contrast it with Job's perspective.

Death is universal. I don't believe that man can produce technological advancement that denies it, though he may be able to delay it. And since it is universal, you have to look forward to it, and have some expectations from it. Some believe it to be an eternal sleep, while other think of it as an eternal party. As for me, I expect complete and eternal joy in Death. And this expectation of mine is rooted in what I believe is the biblical teaching on it.

For a Christian being dead is being present in God's glory. God's glory is all satisfying to mankind. It satisfies his soul, it satisfies his need for intimacy, it satisfies his curiosity and it satisfies all his longings. While on this earth we desire for relationships. We desire for loving parents, loving spouse, loving friends etc. But more often than not, our desires for such relationships are only partly satisfied. Sometimes, when in our longing for such relationships, we pursue to decipher the richness that we may find in them, we are sorely disappointed and greatly let down. When we seek intimacy, many times we recognize the inability of man to display it without selfless motives. And in our efforts to satiate our curiosity, we end up developing paradigms that are after our own image, and not the Creators. In our effort to satiate any of our longings, we run away from the One that can truly satiate them, God. For a Christian however, the opportunity exists to seek the satisfaction of all these longings in God. And while in his mortal being, he starts to taste the overwhelming power of finding satisfaction in God alone, though it still remains fleeting and only a promise. Yet in the death of the justified, a Christian finds eternal and complete fulfillment of these longings, in the glory of the Creator.

In other words, for a Christian being dead is being eternally present in the glory of God that satisfies all of mankind's longings with what is truly everlasting. This satisfaction isn't limited or in part. This satisfaction is complete and God glorifying.

And from this definition I decipher the starkest contrast between Job's expectation of being dead and mine. Job's expectations in being dead derives from what is absent in death, while mine derives from what is present in it. Job's death is devoid of pain and suffering, simply because they seem to be absent. In a Christian's death, the lack of pain and suffering is not merely because of its absence, but primarily because of one's presence in the Glory of God.

Why is this understanding of death and its aftermath so important for a Christian? For without a strong desire for the presence of God in His forthcoming Kingdom, a Christian will never fully appreciate the what is offered to Him. If Eternity is only about what is absent, pain and suffering. Sorrow and sin. Then Eternity simply becomes a escape from the tribulations of this life. Instead if Eternity is about the entering into a new life, where God's presence and His glory is the all encompassing reason for your existence, it stops being a escape and starts being an eternal Home.
