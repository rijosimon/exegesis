# Chapter 3

### The ramblings of a depressed man.

Job is clearly depressed at this point. The burden of his adversity seems to start to get to him. He hasn't yet derided God, or sinned against Him. But neither is he at this point a stoic man submissive with heart and spirit to God's will in his life. Instead he complains about the travails of life, and how if certain measures were in place, he wouldn't have to go through all this.

He complains about:

1. The day he was born. (vs. 1-10)
2. Death not taking him the day he was born. (vs. 11-19)
3. Life given by God to a man who cannot take it anymore. (vs. 20-23)

### 1. The day he was born.

Job seems to be deeply anguished regarding the day he was born. For a day about which he has no memory, it seems to be the one that he despises the most. But this despise is not particularly connected to a time, rather it's association with his existence.

> because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes. (vs. 10)

In other words, what Job despises the most is his existence. So anything he seeks over the day he was born, he seeks over his own existence.

What does Job seek over the day he was born in vs. 1-10?

1. He seeks darkness over it:

> Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it. (vs. 2)

> Let gloom and eep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. The night--let thick darkness seize it! (vs. 3-4)

> Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning. (vs. 9)

2. He seeks curses over it:

> Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan. (vs. 8)

3. He seeks the death of that day itself:

> Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.' (vs. 1)

> let it not come into the number of months. (vs. 6)

4. He seeks no joy or rejoicing over it:

> Let gloom and darkness claim it. (vs. 5)

> Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. (vs. 6)

> let no joyful cry enter it. (vs. 7)
