# Chapter 4

## Can mortal man be in the right before God?

### What is confidence? What is my Hope?

Isn't it true that many times we see in our own lives, that it is easier to console others in the Lord, when they go through their adversity. But in the midst of our own share of it, we are scattered, our peace  is lost and hope is not found.

From the picture that Job's friend Eliphaz the Temanite paints, we get a similar peak into Job's life. Job has been an instructor to many. He has touched so many lives when it comes to strengthening the weak, upholding those that stumble.

But Eliphaz observes a lack of patience in Job's life, with regard to waiting on the Lord, when calamity strikes him. While Job has helped many to not give up and not stop trusting in God in the midst of adversity, when this happens to him, he seems dismayed.

The best of us can be dismayed, when calamity strikes. The best of us will blames other or circumstances when calamity strikes. This is because man on his own strength in completely lacking in trusting on what is constance and what is true. God.

Even Job, whom God finds most faithful, has stopped seeing God as his confidence and his hope, though momentarily, when the adversity of life strikes him. Hence when Eliphaz questions Job's source of confidence and hope, it is God's means of reminding him of who God is and has been in Job's life.

> Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? (vs. 6)

Eliphaz, who has observed Job's life, as his close friend, for many years makes salient observations about where the confidence of Job's life comes from and where is Hope lies.

Fear of God -> confidence.

Integrity of your ways -> hope.

One may ask, how the fear of anything would bring about confidence? <Meditate on why the scripture says that the Fear of God, brings confidence.>
