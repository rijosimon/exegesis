# Genesis 1 (ESV)

### Vs. 1-2: Before there was Light.

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

These two verses holds the pre-creation description of Earth. And I believe it is important to understand it as such to establish a proper understanding of the rest of Creation.
