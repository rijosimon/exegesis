# Genesis 1 (ESV)

### Vs. 1-2: Before there was Light.

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

These two verses holds the pre-creation description of Earth. And I believe it is important to understand it as such to establish a proper understanding of the rest of Creation. Why is understanding pre-creation important for a Christian. I believe the mystery of pre-creation answers the inquiries surrounding the purpose of creation, the purpose of man and its outcome for a Christian.

When the scripture says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." My question is: What is initiated in this beginning?. And to answer that questions we need to have a basic understanding of time.

What is initiated when the scripture says: "In the beginning..."

A few things that come to my mind are:

1. Time itself. (Whose Time?)
2. Universe. (For whom?)
3. Earth. (For whom?)

And for this now let us start with a study of time, both as a physical construct and as a spiritual construct as represented in the scripture.
